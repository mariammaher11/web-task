            <h3>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h3>
            <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
                companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me
                in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>
            <p> I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the
                    world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to
                    sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world
                    of opportuinities.</p>

            <p>  As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
                that's holding you back is yourself.</p>
            <p>A qoute I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
            <p>"How big would you dream, if you knew you would't fail?" <br />
                You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer,
                it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in
                something you're passionate about.</p>

                your company.</p>
